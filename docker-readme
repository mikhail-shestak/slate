Run Slate with:

$ docker-compose up.

You can now see the docs at http://localhost:4567. Whoa! That was fast!

To build a local static copy of your API documentation into the build directory, run

$ docker run --rm -v $PWD:/usr/src/app/source -w /usr/src/app/source slate_app bundle exec middleman build --clean

Note: If you've changed the name of the parent folder, change slate_app to the new name in this format <foldername>_app.
Alternatively, find the exact name of your docker image by running docker ps.
